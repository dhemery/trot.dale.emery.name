In his <strong><a href="http://www.physorg.com/news130861756.html">plan to break the record for highest skydive</a></strong> (and the records for fastest freefall, longest freefall, and highest altitude reached in a balloon), Michel Fournier has every contingency covered.

Er... <strong><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/weather/news/2008-05-27-fournier-loses-balloon_N.htm?csp=34">except one</a></strong>.

Hasn't he ever seen <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>?
