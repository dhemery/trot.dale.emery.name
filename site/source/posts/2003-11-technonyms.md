<p> Many product names describe a benefit of the product. The name <em>telephone,</em> for example, tells us about a product that sends sounds across long distances. <em>Dishwasher</em> tells us about a product that washes dishes. I like those names. Simple and direct. </p>
<p> Other names tell us, not about a benefit of the product, but about a feature &#8212; in particular, about the technology on which the product is based. <em>Cable television,</em> for example, tells us about how the television signal is transmitted: through cables. What makes cable television better than other television? To answer that question, we need information that isn't in the name. </p>
<p> Over time, we often shorten that sort of name, eliminating even the category of product, and leaving only the name of the underlying technology. Cable television becomes <em>cable.</em> Vacuum cleaners becomes a <em>vacuums.</em> Microwave ovens becomes a <em>microwaves.</em> Even a popcorn designed to be cooked in a microwave oven becomes <em>microwave.</em>
</p>
<p> I made up a word for that kind of name: <em>technonym.</em>
<strong> A technonym is a product name that has become so abbreviated that it tells us <em>only</em> about the technology on which the product is based, and nothing about either the benefits of the product or even the <em>category</em> of product. </strong> Cable.  Vacuum.  Microwave.  Film.  Stereo.  Radio. </p>
<p> And lately, just as I was getting used to technonyms, we're seeing a whole category of products whose names tell us about what technology the product <em>isn't</em> based on: <em>wireless.</em> Wireless telephones. Wireless networks. (Actually, referring to products as "wireless" <a href="http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_telegraphy">is an old practice</a>.) </p>
<p> What other technonyms do you know? </p>
