<a href="http://www.metafilter.com/">MetaFilter</a> pointed me to this beautiful story about <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/sports/5739079.htm">Natalie Gilbert and Maurice Cheeks</a>. If this doesn't bring a tear to your eye, you need to visit the Emerald City and beg the wizard to give you a heart. </p>
<p> The Portland Trail Blazers' web site has <a href="http://www.nba.com/blazers/features/Cheeks_Anthem_Assist-73713-41.html">another nice report</a>, and a video. </p>
<p> After watching the video, I am in awe that Natalie was able to sing on key. </p>
