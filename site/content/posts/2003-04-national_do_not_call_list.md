Thanks to Suzanne for [reminding me](http://trot.dale.emery.name/2003/04/what_to_say_to_telemarketers/#comment-12) about the national Do-Not-Call list, which will be implemented soon. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) publishes a national ["Do Not Call" registry web site](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/donotcall/index.html) with details for consumers and telemarketers. You can register on the national list starting in July, and the FTC will begin enforcing the do-not-call rules starting in October.

I have a hunch: you will be getting lots of telemarketing calls in September.
