    * Helps people understand the code's purpose
    * Helps people trust the code
    * Separates purpose from implementation
    * Helps explain incidental details
    * Helps people find code
    * Motivates moving things where they belong
    * Makes it easier to see where things belong
    * Makes it easier to see whether things belong together

* Maintenance and defects

    * Eases maintenance
    * Moves incidental details out of the way
    * Reduces reasons to duplicate code
    * Helps detect errors in the code
    * Makes duplication easier to identify
    * Motivates reducing duplication
    * Makes incoherence easier to identify
