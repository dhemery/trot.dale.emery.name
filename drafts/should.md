I've trained myself to notice
when the people I'm coaching
use the word "should."
_Should_ typically conveys one of four meanings:
Expectation,
advice,
command,
morality.

# Expectation

"I should be done writing the flambot module done by Thursday."

# Advice

"You should refactor your code."

The advisory should
expresses advice
in the context of some goal.
The goal is often left tacit,
as in the example above.
Sometimes the advisor states the goal explicitly:
"If you want your code to be maintainable,
you should refactor it."

People often utter advisory shoulds
without checking whether the listener
has a goal for which the advice applies.
Listeners who have no such goal
can hear an advisory should
as a moral should.

Even if listeners do have the relevant goal,
if they do not see how the advice
helps to achieve the goal,
they may hear the advisory should
as a moral should.

One way to avoid this misintepretation
is to test whether the listener
does indeed have the goal
that the advice supports.

I prefer instead
to rephrase my advice
to make it clearer that it is advice,
and that it is in support of a specific goal:
"Refactoring your code will make it more maintainable."

## Sufficient or Necessary

Note that my phrasing changes the meaning of the advice in important way.
Compare:

 1. "Refactoring your code will make it more maintainable."
 1. "If you want to make your code maintainable, you should refactor it."

The first phrasing expresses sufficiency:
Refactoring,
in and of itself,
will make the code more maintainable.

The second phrasing goes further.
It expresses not only sufficiency,
but necessity:
Refactoring is the _only_ way to make your code more maintainable.

The first phrasing does not express necessity.
It leaves open the possibility
that there may be other ways to make code maintainable.

But this is a somewhat subtle meaning.
The advisory should
hints at necessity
without stating it boldly.
When I mean "this is the only way,"
I prefer to make the necessity explicit:
"The only way to make your code more maintainable is to refactor it."
This is a very strong claim.

# Command

"You should come to my party tonight."

# Moral Demand

"You should work harder to meet your estimates."
