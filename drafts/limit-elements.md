Increasing the number of elements of technology
involved in an automated test:

-   Increases number of variables that contribute to the results.
-   Increases the number of contributing variables that are not controlled by the test.
-   Increases the likelihood of failure.
-   Decreases the likelihood that a failure describes the system’s satisfaction of the responsibility that the test is intended to assess.
-   Increases the number of places you have to look to identify the fault.
-   Increases the number of variables whose values you would need to know in order to understand the meaning and significance of the test results.
-   Increases the number of contributing variables whose values you do not know.
-   Decreases the likelihood that a single execution yields sufficient information to identify the fault.
-   Decreases the likelihood that any number of executions yields sufficient information to identify the fault.

And it does all of those things regardless of whether the system actually satisfies the responsibility being tested.

So: Limit the number of elements of technology involved in an automated test.
