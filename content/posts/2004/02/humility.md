<p> And the winner of the 2004 Dale H. Emery Humility Award is... </p>
<p> Dale H. Emery, of course. </p>
<p> The Dale H. Emery Humility Award is awarded only by me, because I'm the only person qualified to assess people's humility. And it's named after me in order to give it the prestige its receipients deserve. So far, I am the only person who has received the award &#8212; I am, in fact, the only person ever to be <em>nominated</em> &#8212; because I'm so much more humble than everyone else. </p>
