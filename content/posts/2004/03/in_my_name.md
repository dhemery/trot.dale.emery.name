<p> About a year ago I was watching a DVD of a Steve Earle concert.  He introduced one song by explaining his objection to the death penalty: "I object to the government killing people because I object to <em>me</em> killing people, and the government is acting in my name." </p>
<p> As the presidential campaign goes into full sling, I find myself thinking about Earle's statement â€” not just with respect to the death penalty, but as a general principle: <em>In my name.</em>  What if I were to accept that the President of the United States acts in my name?  And what if I were to accept personal responsibility for that? </p>
<p> The "in my name" principle lends clarity, meaning, and significance as I decide who to vote for:  What would this person do in my name?  How well would those actions reflect my values? </p>
