<p> The word hippopotamus is derived from the Greek words <em>hippos</em> (horse) and <em>potamos</em> (river).  River horse.  Hippopotamus. </p>
<p> Here's a new noun I just made up:  <em>hippobottomus.</em>  From the Greek <em>hippos</em> (horse) and the common English <em>bottom</em> (buttocks).  Hippobottomus.  Horse's ass. </p>
<p> I also made up the verb <em>hippopotamize,</em> but I don't yet know what it means.  To transform something into a hippopotamus?  To dunk a horse in the river?  To turn a river into a horse, the way Liv Tyler did in <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</em>? </p>
