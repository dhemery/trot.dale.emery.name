<p> A song I'm writing about Brita the dog. </p>
<p> She likes to eat her dinner<br /> She eats til it's all in her<br /> She used to be much thinner<br /> She's Brita the Brita the dog </p>
<p> She likes to drink her water<br /> She drinks it like she oughter<br /> 'Cause she's some bitch's daughter<br /> She's Brita the Brita the dog </p>
<p> (Bridge)<br /> She likes to eat the feline feces<br /> The tasty poop of another species </p>
<p> (Chorus)<br /> She's the dog<br /> With the face<br /> Of a dog-faced dog </p>
