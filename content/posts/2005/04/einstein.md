<p>I find myself annoyed every time someone says, "Einstein's definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result."</p>
<p>Now, I find that definition annoying no matter who it's attributed to, but attributing it to Einstein really takes the cake.  I've done some searching, and I can't find any credible evidence that Einstein ever said such a thing.  My guess is that people attribute this definition to Einstein not because he said it, but because attributing it to Einstein gives it credibility.  Bah.</p>
<p>Whether Einstein actually defined insanity that way or not, people attribute to Einstein all kinds of stuff that he never said.  Over time, I've noticed a few patterns that I now want to immortalize as theories.  And I want to put my name into the theories along with Einstein's, because that will give me credibility.</p>
<p>
<strong>Emery's Einstein Aphorism Attribution Acquisition Theory:</strong>  Any saying of uncertain origin will eventually be attributed to Einstein.</p>
<p>
<strong>Emery's Einstein Aphorism Attribution Adhesion Theory:</strong> Any saying, once attributed to Einstein, will be attributed to Einstein forever after.</p>
<p>If we combine these two theories, we arrive at a third:</p>
<p>
<strong>Emery's Einstein Aphorism Attribution Accretion Theory:</strong> Einstein will eventually have said everything.</p>
<p>Kinda like entropy, but in reverse.</p>
