<p> Here are the only two lines from an unfinished song called <em>Standoff</em>: </p>
<blockquote>
<em> I've been waiting for God to say anything. <br /> God's been waiting for me to believe. </em>
</blockquote>
<p> The melody is interesting and the chords are peculiar. If only I knew what the rest of the words were. </p>
