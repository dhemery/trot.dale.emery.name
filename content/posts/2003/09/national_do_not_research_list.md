<p> In the past week, I've been called by 10 "market research firms." I put the term in quotes because I suspect that the callers are really telemarketing companies calling to pre-qualify me. My guess is that their "research" questions are carefully designed to offer repeated opportunities for me to inadvertently give them permission to make a sales call. </p>
<p> So far, I've ended each call immediately by hanging up. So I haven't yet tested my suspicions about the callers' intentions. Still, I'm suspicious, and here's why. </p>
<p> I told one caller to "put me on your do-not-call list." She replied that, as a marketing research firm, her company was exempt from the do-not-call list. I thought her reply was telling. The exemption is, to me, beside the point. &#8212; beside <em>my</em> point, at least. Even before the national do-not-call list regulations were developed, some telemarketers would put me on their private do-not-call lists if I asked. And they would do it politely. So this "marketing research firm" could just as easily maintain a private do-not-call list. But she didn't say, "Yes, sir, I will put you on the list right away. I apologize for the inconvenience." She didn't say, "We don't have a do-not-call list." She said, "We're exempt," as if exemption were the issue, and as if my desire not to be called again didn't matter. If it waddles like a telemarketer and quacks like a telemarketer... </p>
<p> My other reason for being suspicious is that, before this week, I've been called by market research firms about three times a year. Now 10 of them call in a week. And I'm hearing similar reports from friends and relatives. Given my <a href="http://dale.emery.name/trot/2003/07/national_call_right_away_list/">earlier predictions</a> of increased sales calls in September, the timing of this increase in "market research" calls is too coincidental to be a coincidence. </p>
<p> I suddenly fear that my prediction of "four times as many telemarketing calls in September" was woefully rosy. Every telemarketer will create a subsidiary "market research firm" that will call to extract the slightest hint of permission, overriding your explicit request &#8212; which you made by registering with the national do-not-call list &#8212; that you do not want to be called. </p>
<p> Why are telemarketers are so eager to call people who have asked not to be called? At first glance, do-not-call registrants would seem to be low probability prospects. But perhaps the economics of telemarketing are such that even a low probability is high enough to create large profits. </p>
<p> Given that, I now predict that if the courts allow the national do-not-call list to proceed, you will receive <em>more</em> telemarketing calls in the future, not fewer. But the callers will all be "market research firms." And I predict that, because market research firms are exempt from the do-not-call regulations, and because they are not pressured by the threat of being regulated, the callers will be less polite when you ask them not to call. </p>
<p> I thought that the national do-not-call list was a good idea. I forgot the law of unintended consequences. And I forgot that telemarketers are far more adaptable than the U. S. bureaucracy. D'oh! </p>
