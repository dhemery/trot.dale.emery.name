<p> I have a prediction. First, some background. </p>
<p> Here's a quote from the "<a href="http://www.donotcall.gov/FAQ/FAQBusiness.aspx">Information for Businesses</a>" section of the <a href="http://www.donotcall.gov">National Do Not Call Registry</a> website: </p>
<blockquote>
<p> Consumers can register online or via phone now. In September 2003, telemarketers, sellers and their service providers will have access to the registry. They will be required to scrub their call lists against the National Do Not Call Registry at least once every three months. </p>
<p> On October 1, 2003, the FTC and the States will start to enforce the National Do Not Call Registry provisions of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule. Violators are subject to a fine of up to $11,000 per violation. All covered sellers and telemarketers must access the National Do Not Call Registry in September 2003 if they plan to make covered calls after October 1, 2003. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> In essence, this says that in September, the government will deliver to telemarketers a giant list of "people you'd better call before October 1." </p>
<p> My prediction: <strong> Everyone who registers by August 31 will receive at least four times as many telemarketing calls in September as they have ever received in any prior month. </strong>
</p>
<p> I still say it's worth it. </p>
