<p> Up until now, I've used <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> to publish my weblogs. For a number of reasons, which I won't go into here, I have written my own blogging system. </p>
<p> Before I use my new system on my business weblog (<em>
<a href="http://www.dhemery.com/journal/index.html">Conversations with Dale</a>
</em>), I want to make sure it works here on my not-so-serious blog, <em>Twelfth Root of Two</em>. </p>
<p>
<strong>I'd like your help</strong> to make sure it works. One of my goals is for everything to look the same as it did before. (Well, <em>almost</em> the same &#8212; see below.) So please poke around a bit, to make sure everything looks right. </p>
<p> I'm especially eager to learn whether the commenting system works correctly. Please test that by adding a comment or two. If you find an interesting entry that you want to comment about, do that. Otherwise, just post a comment for this entry, and let me know that you're "just testing." I'll remove the "just testing" comments later. </p>
<p> There is one thing that I want to look different. The pages that show multiple entries &#8212; the home page and the archive pages &#8212; now show <em>summaries</em> instead of full entries. I'm not sure yet whether I will prefer this. Let me know what you think. </p>
