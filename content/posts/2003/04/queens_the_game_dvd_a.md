<p> Queen is translating "The Game" into DVD-A format, remixing all of the songs for 5.1 surround sound. <a href="http://www.brianmaynews.com/queen/thegame/briansnotes.html">Brian May</a> and <a href="http://www.brianmaynews.com/queen/thegame/technical.html">Justin Shirley-Smith</a> have posted their notes about the process on <a href="http://www.brianmaynews.com">Brian's web site</a>. I was fascinated by Justin's technical notes. </p>
<p> Gotta get me a 5.1 system so I can hear this stuff the way they intended. </p>
