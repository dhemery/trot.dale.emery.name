<strong>The Story.</strong> Ttimm wrote the first verse and the chorus, and played the song for me one day when I was visiting, in late 1981. I think we wrote the second and third verses together. </p>
<p> We were repeatedly interrupted during the recording. At one point, one of Ttimm's four-year-old nephews interrupted us to announce that "Aunt Cindy got some poop on her pants." We continued recording, holding up stoically in the face of that tragic news. </p>
<p> Ginger&#8212;aka "Stegmutt, the wonder beast"&#8212;was unclear about the timing of her crucial part. She started singing enthusiastically, but early, any number of times. Finally (at take nine), Ttimm and I finished our parts without Ginger's embellishments. Alas, by the time we cued Ginger to sing, her enthusiasm had flagged. Ttimm and I pleaded and encouraged for 30 minutes, and Ginger stepped up to the microphone and, in one take, belted out a beautiful, improvised, song-ending aria. </p>
<p>
<strong>Warning.</strong> We've known children, upon hearing <em>Eat the Animals</em> one time, to sing it to their parents for hours on end. You don't want that. Take appropriate precautions. </p>
<p>
<strong>Instruments.</strong>
<em>Guitar</em>: Probably Ttimm's Applause. </p>
<p>
<strong>Recording.</strong> Recorded on some kind of four track stereo reel-to-reel; probably Ttimm's Akai. </p>
