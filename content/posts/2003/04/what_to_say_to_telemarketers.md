<p> There's a magic phrase that makes telemarketers stop telemarketing and politely say goodbye. </p>
<p> The magic phrase is <strong>"Put me on your <em>do-not-call</em> list."</strong> When you say this, almost every telemarketer will say something polite, like, "Thank you, sir," or "We're sorry for the inconvenience." </p>
<p> Saying the magic phrase is better than simply hanging up. If you just hang up, they call again another day. If you tell them to put you on the do-not-call list, they put you on the do-not-call list. Then they do not call. Magic! </p>
<p> You're welcome. </p>
