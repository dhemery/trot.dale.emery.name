<p> A few weeks ago, I bought a pair of slippers at Nordstrom. As I checked out, the check-out guy dropped a CD into my bag. </p>
<p> The CD is called "nordstrom loves shoes," and it contains eight shoe-related songs. One of the songs, of course, is Carl Perkins's "Blue Suede Shoes." Another is "These Boots Are Made For Walking," by... no, guess again... The Supremes!  Who knew? There's also "Boogie Shoes" by KC and the Sunshine band, and a great country tune called "Ruby Shoes" by Jessica Andrews. </p>
<p> Apparently, Norstrom was giving this CD as a gift to everyone who made a purchase in their shoe department that day. On my way home, I wondered, "What if I'd bought underwear?" </p>
