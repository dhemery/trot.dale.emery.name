Lisa, Ray (Lisa's dad) and I saw the Guarneri String Quartet play at <a href="http://www.csus.edu">California State University Sacramento</a> last night. They played:

<ul>
	<li>Lukas Foss — <em>String Quartet No. 5</em></li>
	<li>Bela Bartok — <em>String Quartet No. 6 in D Major</em></li>
	<li>Ludwig van Beethoven — <em>String Quartet No. 9 in C Major</em></li>
</ul>

I always love listening to Beethoven's string quartets—I often have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000041LL/dalehemer-20">Philips edition</a> playing in my office. My favorite piece of the night was Foss's <em>String Quartet No. 5.</em> I haven't the slightest idea how to describe it to you — modern, but (unlike many of the modern pieces I've heard) accessible to my unsophisticated ear. Foss wrote the piece in 2000, specifically for The Guarneri String Quartet. I hope they record it one of these days, because I'd love to hear it again.
