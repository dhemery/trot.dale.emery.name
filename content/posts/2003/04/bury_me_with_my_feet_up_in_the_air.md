<strong>Performance.</strong>
<em>All vocals, all guitars, bass, drum programming</em>: Dale Emery. </p>

<strong>The Story.</strong> I wrote <em>Bury Me</em> around 1976, when I was 17. My friend Ttimm Roy recorded a Ttimm-o-phonic version in 1979 on his sophomore album <em>Taxi to Portland</em> (now out of print, I'm sad to say). I recorded <em>Bury Me</em> in November 2001, then re-recorded lots of the parts in June 2002, after I'd bought a better microphone and written a better bass line. </p>
