<p> I went to Borders on Friday to buy some business stuff and the <em>Animatrix DVD</em>. The parking lot was kinda full, which is odd for mid-afternoon. </p>
<p> As I got to the door, I realized why there were so many people. Ted Nugent was sitting at a table, in front of which was a <em>very</em> long line of people waiting for Ted to sign copies of his book  <em>Kill It and Grill It</em>.  </p>
<p> Though I am a big fan of Ted's hat, I'm not a fan of his music, so I went about my errands. When he was done signing, he came whizzing by me on his way to the bathroom, with a look of focus and determination on his face, and a gaggle of hangers on hanging on. </p>
