<p> Don't do this. </p>
<p> Don't rummage through the box in the back of your closet and brush off the guilty-secret copy of <em>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000032H5/dalehemer-20">The Best of Gilbert O'Sullivan</a>
</em> that you've hidden there so as not to lose the love and respect that your friends and family have for you. </p>
<p> And if you do it anyway, even though I told you not to, don't put it into your CD player and select track six, <em>Alone Again (Naturally)</em>. </p>
<p> And if you do that anyway, even though I told you not to, don't decide, when the words start, that it would be more fun to sing, not the words "In a little while from now..." but instead the words and melody to the first verse of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000000OAN/dalehemer-20">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>, "Mama, just killed a man..." </p>
<p> And if you do that anyway, even though I told you not to, and destroy forever your ability to enjoy one of the best songs ever written (you <em>do</em> know which one I mean, don't you?), don't blame me. </p>
<p> Because I told you not to. </p>
