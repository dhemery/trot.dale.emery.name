<p> I woke yesterday with pressure in my left ear. I knew what that meant. I'd had a nasty ear infection two years earlier, which taught me to visit my doctor at the earliest hint of that twinge. </p>
<p> I went to the local hospital's emergency room. A nurse practitioner peeked into my ear. Quietly, with an eastern-European accent, she said, "You have wugs in there." </p>
<p> "Wugs?" I said. I had no idea what <em>wugs</em> were. Some kind of growth? </p>
<p> "Not wugs.  Woks." </p>
<p> "Woks?" </p>
<p> "Yes, woks. I will have to remove it." </p>
<p> Did she say <em>it?</em> What did that mean? I know that "it" is a singular pronoun. And having read about <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wug_test">The Wug Test</a> in Steven Pinker's book  <em>The Language Instinct</em>,  I know that "wugs" is plural. So when the nurse said "it," she must have been referring to something other than the wugs. </p>
<p> Laughing nervously, I asked, "Have to remove what?  My ear?" </p>
<p> "No, not the ear. The <em>wahcks.</em>" </p>
<p> Oh!  The wax! </p>
<p> As of today, I still have both ears, and no wugs. And I'm feeling much better. </p>
