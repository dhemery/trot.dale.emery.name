<p> Here's another fun tune from Tt&#239;mm and me, called "Brainwave Surfin'." I've posted an  <a href="http://dale.emery.name/songs/#brainwave-surfin">mp3 version</a> on my <a href="http://dale.emery.name/songs/">Songs page</a> for your listening pleasure. </p>
<p>
<strong>Songwriting</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Words and Music:</em> Tt&#239;mm Roy and Dale Emery. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Performance</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Vocals:</em>     Dale Emery (generally the higher parts)     and Tt&#239;mm Roy (generally the lower parts). </li>
<li>
<em>Guitar, Keyboards, Bass:</em>     Dale. </li>
<li>
<em>Drums:</em>     Tt&#239;mm. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Story.</strong> Tt&#239;mm had been talking for years about writing a song called "Brainwave Surfin'." One afternoon we decided to write it, and it came out very quickly once we got started. It took about a half hour to write, and we spent the rest of the day recording. </p>
<p> I don't know what Tt&#239;mm knew about surfing at the time (or even now, come to think of it), and everything I knew came from Beach Boys songs. At one point in the song we needed to refer to some popular surfing site. In "Surfin' USA" the Beach Boys mention Doheny Way, and we made up a rhyme for that. If you listen carefully (and of course you're listening carefully!) you can hear that I mispronounce it "Toheny". </p>
<p> Adam Sherman's Strat-o-caster was lying around &#8212; Private Lightning had broken up, and Scott Woodman and Adam Sherman were considering starting a new band, and were rehearsing on weekends in Tt&#239;mm's house &#8212; so we used that rather than my Ibanez Musician. </p>
<p> Tt&#239;mm played like a madman on drums. He'd recently bought an old reverb unit. It had a very funky sound and had one of those green <a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/drg45nzp/eyes.html">eye tubes</a> that old radios and tape recorders used to have. We ran the drums through that, and liked the "empty high school gymnasium" sound. </p>
<p> We did our best to emulate the Beach Boys, but... well... they're the Beach Boys and we're us. </p>
